# Tanzania Primary Education Results (NECTA PSLE)

### 1. Business and Data Understanding

Problem Statement:<br>
***What are the best predictors for school performance on the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)?***
* Features (Xi): capitation grants, teachers, books, location proxies
* Class label (y): average score quintile

Scope:
* Results from entire Tanzania Mainland: **26 regions, 184 councils, 17,900 primary schools**
* Start with 2022 PSLE (administered in September 2022, results published in December 2022)

Exploration points:
* Are there hidden groupings of schools by feature?
* How does council/regional variation effect predictions?
